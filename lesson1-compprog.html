               <p> <font size="3px", color="brown"><em>Programming</em></font> has a rich history that spans a number of decades. <br><br>
                History of Programming Languages presents information pertinent to the technical aspects of the language design and creation. This lesson provides an understanding of the processes of language design as related to the environment in which languages are developed and the knowledge base available to the originators. <br><br>
                  The history of programming languages spans from documentation of early mechanical computers to modern tools for software development. Early programming languages were highly specialized, relying on mathematical notation and similarly obscure syntax. Throughout the 20th century, research
                  in compiler theory led to the creation of high-level programming languages, which use a more accessible syntax to communicate instructions. </p>

             <div class="info text">
               <div class="title">More Information</div>
                <p>The first high-level programming language was Plankalkül, created by Konrad Zuse between 1942 and 1945.The first high-level language to have an associated compiler was created by Corrado Böhm in 1951, for his PhD thesis.The first commercially available language was FORTRAN
                  (FORmula TRANslation), developed in 1956 (first manual appeared in 1956, but first developed in 1954) by a team led by John Backus at IBM.
                  <br><br>
                  Ada Lovelace and Charles Babbage collaborated on the Analytical Engine, a rudimentary mechanical computer, in 1883 to create the first programming language. Lovelace recognized the significance of numbers, understanding that they might express more than just numerical quantities.
                  To compute Bernoulli numbers, Lovelace devised an algorithm for the Analytical Engine, the first computer software.
                  <br><br>
                  - Ada and the World's First Computer
                  In 1949, assembly language was introduced as a sort of computer programming language capable of simplifying machine code language, which is required to instruct a computer what to do.
                  <br><br>
                  - Alick Glennie created Autocode in 1952, which some see as the first compiled computer programming language. This means that it might be converted straight into machine language.
                  <br><br>
                  - FORTRAN, a computer programming language for scientific, mathematical, and statistical purposes, was designed by John Backus in 1957.

               <div class="title">Facts</div>
               <p>The <font size="3px", color="brown"><em>later programming languages</em></font> were invented in the late 1950's where the modern languages' characteristics are very apparent:
                <br><br>
                - Mr. John Backus
                  Algol was designed in 1958 as an algorithmic language. It was also a forerunner of programming languages like Java and C.
                  <br><br>
                  - Dr. Grace Murray Hopper designed COBOL in 1959 as a language that could run on all sorts of computers.
                  <br><br>
                  - Hopper, Grace Murray
                  LISP, which is still used today, was designed by John McCarthy in 1959. This programming language was created for artificial intelligence research and is now compatible with Python and Ruby.
                  <br><br>
                  - LISP's Origins
                  1964: John G. Kemeny and Thomas E. Kurtz created BASIC to allow students who did not have a solid foundation in technology or arithmetic to utilize computers.
                  <br><br>
                  - Pascal Language Information
                  Alan Kay, Adele Goldberg, and Dan Ingalls created Smalltalk in 1972, allowing computer programmers to alter code fast.
                  <br><br>
                  - Dennis Ritchie created C in 1972, which is widely recognized as the first high-level programming language. This indicates it's more like human language than machine code.
                  <br><br>
                  - C is a programming language.
                  Donald D. Chamberlin and Raymond F. Boyce created SQL for IBM in 1972. This language was used to examine and modify data in databases.</p>
